##Purpose of the analysis
During my past vacation in the beautiful island of Hawaii I discovered a new passion. Surfing!
Life is too short for one not to live to the fullest. So I've decided I will pursue my dreams of everlasting stoke and will enbark on an endless summer journey. I will open a Surf and Ice Cream shack in Hawaii and live there to the end of times. 
While I do have a decent amount of savings to kickstart this endeavor, I will still need investor backing.
I met with a potential investor, W. Avy, and he is very interested on my proposal. Before fully committing, however, W.  Avy wants to see some data analysis about temperatures in Hawaii both in June and in December. He wants to be sure temperatures are high enough for the business to be hot, and for clients to be frothing for tasty waves and delicious ice creams.
To tackle W. Avy's request, I've performed data analysis on a temperature dataset that he has provided using Pandas and SQLite.
